## CSCI 23000 Computing I ((Final Year Porject))

You will implement a mini version of Canvas, with data stored in csv files, e.g. use one file to store usernames and passwords, one file to store courses taken by a user etc. You will implement an admin module and a student module. When the admin module runs, the user will login and be able to add students and the courses they take. The information will be saved into csv files. When the student module runs, the user will login and be able to see the courses they take (based on data entered by the admin and stored in csv files). Whenever an admin enters more information in future runs, it will append to the existing csv files. 

## Installation:
-  `pip install utils`
-  `pip install python-csv`

## Run:

- `Python user.py`
